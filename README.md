`Windows Template Library` - `WTL 10` (Hacked by [shines77](https://github.com/shines77/))

`WTL` is a `C++` library for developing `Windows` applications and UI components. It extends `ATL` and provides a set of classes for controls, dialogs, frame windows, GDI objects, and more.

# Introduction

`Windows Template Library`, or `WTL`, is a set of classes that extend `ATL` to support more complex user interfaces for either applications or various UI components, while maintaining the big advantage of `ATL` - small and fast code. `WTL` classes were designed to be the best and the easiest way to implement rich `Win32` based UI for `ATL` based applications, servers, components, and controls.

`WTL` provides support for implementing many user interface elements, from frame and popup windows, to MDI, standard and common controls, common dialogs, property sheets and pages, GDI objects, UI updating, scrollable windows, splitter windows, command bars, etc. The `WTL` classes are mostly templated and use minimal instance data and inline functions. They were not designed as a framework, so they do not force a particular application model, and can accommodate any. The classes do not use hooks or thread local storage, so they have no restrictions that those techniques impose. They also have no inter-dependencies and can be freely mixed with straight `SDK` code. In summary, `WTL` delivers very small and efficient code, very close in size and speed to `SDK` programs, while presenting a more logical, object oriented model to a programmer.
